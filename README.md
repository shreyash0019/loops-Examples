# Python Code Repository

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating the usage of `for` loops and `while` loops.

## Examples

### For Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range). Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### While Loop

The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. Example:

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(f"Counter is {counter}")
    counter += 1
```

**Output:**
```
Counter is 0
Counter is 1
Counter is 2
Counter is 3
Counter is 4
```
